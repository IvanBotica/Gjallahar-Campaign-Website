        <p class="ymirtxt mand"> <span class="njord category">world</span> <br> <br> Gjallahar is an ice-covered appendix at the edge of the known world. A vast and complex world which the Gjallar people take no part in. In fact, many believe the rest of the world does not exist in the first place.
          Isolated by sky-piercing mountain ranges, unrelenting seas and merciless wastes, the Gjallar have decided they have enough problems as is, what with the lack of crops and warmth and all. 
          Death is plentiful, misery abundant, and the gods forgetful.

        <p class="factiontxt mand"> <span class="njord category">factions</span> <br> <br> Division of labor is the most important factor to progressing any large-scale operation, such as a society. 
          Unfortunately for Gjallahar, these divisions are sometimes grounds for conflict of interest - and often conflict of steel. 
          Highly capable groups of people spend a lot of their time trying to grab power in any way they can.

      <div class="intro-politics">
        <p class="politicstxt mand"> <span class="njord category">POLITICS</span> <br> <br> In a newly-reborn land like Gjallahar, politics are bound to be rocky terrain. Given that violence is among their favored hobbies, ruling and advising can be a volatile career path. No matter how many people you try to please, there will always be that many more who are dissapointed with your efforts.

        <p class="godstxt mand"> <span class="njord category">GODS</span> <br> <br> The new gods ascend and the elder ones perish. Thousands of years ago, a war of the divine took place over the mortals in Gjallahar. Ice and nature, thunder and plague, against fire, gold, blood and smoke. Today, not much is heard of the Elder gods. Instead, few ambitious mortals fight to maintain the control it had taken so long for them to achieve.

      <div class="intro-magic">
        <p class="magictxt mand"> <span class="njord category">MAGIC</span> <br> <br> The soil was once soaked in the arcane in Gjallahar. Today, not much of it remains. Whatever survived is divided into two umbrella categories: Rune magic and Prime magic. 
          Rune magic is more akin to engineering and chemistry, with complex formulae, ingredients and requirements. 
          Prime magic is the mysterious force once woven into the fabric of the world. A mysterious force which has become uncommon, and is facing the threat of extinction, if not cared for properly.
